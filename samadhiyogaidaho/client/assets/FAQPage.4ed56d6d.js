It's good to have clothes that keep you cool when you are active in yoga."},{q:"Do I need to be flexible to do yoga?",a:"No you don't have to be flexible to do yoga It is an urban myth that people who tight can't do yoga.

Once you practice yoga for a period of time naturally you will gain flexibility with a myriad of other benefits"},{q:"What is Vinyasa Yoga?",a:"Vinyasa yoga focuses on connecting the breath to your movements, which tend to be set at a faster pace. In a vinyasa practice, you can expect to stay in a constant flow of movements."},{q:"What is Baptiste style yoga?",a:"Baptiste power yoga is a type of Vinyasa yoga with the poses flowing from one to another in a sequence rather than being held for seconds or even minutes, as is the case in some other forms of yoga."},{q:"What is Yin Yoga?",a:"Yin Yoga is a slower-paced, more meditative version of the popular physical and spiritual discipline of yoga. In Yin yoga, the poses are held for a long period of time (typically three to five minutes or longer) to target the connective tissues (such as the ligaments) rather than focusing on the muscles"}]}},components:{ParticleComponent:u}},l=o=>(I("data-v-316b3d34"),o=o(),W(),o),$={id:"hero-section"},F={class:"hero-image d-flex flex-column align-items-center justify-content-center"},j={class:"tsparticles"},B={class:"text-center container"},P={delay:200,id:"shadow1",class:"font-1 text-shadow page-title courgette fw-bolder text-light"},Q=c(" How Can We Help You?
