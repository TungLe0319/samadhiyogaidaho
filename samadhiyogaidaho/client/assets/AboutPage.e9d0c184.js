I\u2019m Katie, and I LOVE to get to share the beauty of yoga with others! I have been practicing yoga for about ten years now, and made the jump in 2021 to train for and receive my 200 hr yoga teacher certification. I specialized in the Baptiste methodology, but now also teach Vinyasa, yin, and power! </p><p class="text-start p-2 fs-4 mt-md-5" data-v-8c0e9048> I love music with my whole soul and love to incorporate music into my classes. You\u2019ll always catch me flowing to some classic gangster rap or Edm. Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Eminem, Tupac, Troyboi, and Flume. I love to sing and if your lucky, you might catch me singing in shavasana at the end of your practice.</p><p class="text-start p-2 fs-4 mt-md-5" data-v-8c0e9048>I\u2019m a lover of animals, I\u2019m a fur mom to @icecubester @lunameowgood and a beta fish named Ray.
