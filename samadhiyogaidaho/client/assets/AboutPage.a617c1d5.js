I&#39;m Katie, and I absolutely love to get to share the beauty and peace of yoga with others. After practicing yoga for ten years, I decided I wanted to bring yoga to others to enrich their lives the same way mine has been enriched and took the plunge to get my RYT 200. I teach Baptiste power yoga, Vinyasa style, Yin, and Restorative yoga. I love music with my whole soul and love to incorporate music into my classes. I love to sing and if you&#39;re lucky, you might catch me singing in savasana at the end of your practice. </p><p class="fs-5 text-start" data-v-40f5ef0b> My favorite thing to do in the world is to put together fully inclusive and restorative yoga retreats for people to get to know themselves and their bodies better. I have always been a planner. I love putting together great events and being able to bring humans closer together and closer to their truest, most authentic selves. I want to travel the world and have plans to host retreats globally all around the world someday. I believe that you can find peace within yourself, and accept the deepest, darkest parts of yourself once you accept and practice the eight limbs of yoga in your life. </p><p class="fs-5 text-start" data-v-40f5ef0b> When I\u2019m not teaching yoga, planning retreats, or working at my day job in finance, you can catch me spending time with my partner and our fur babies either traveling, exploring breweries and wineries, painting oil landscapes and animals, or spending time with family. My favorite place to visit and the place I feel most at peace is the ocean and like to incorporate a water theme in practice often. On top of everything else, I\u2019m going to school right now to get my bachelor&#39;s in business management and plan to get my doctorates someday. </p><p class="fs-5 text-start" data-v-40f5ef0b> That\u2019s a little about me, thanks for taking the time to get to know me and for supporting me and my business! </p></div></div>',2);function M(t,W,q,E,F,H){const d=y("ParticleTest"),i=r("motion-slide-top"),l=r("motion-slide-bottom");return o(),a("div",w,[e("div",x,[m(d)]),e("div",I,[e("div",k,[s((o(),a("h1",P,T)),[[i]]),s((o(),a("p",A,V)),[[i]])])]),e("div",Y,[e("div",$,[e("div",j,[e("div",N,[s((o(),a("p",O,K)),[[l]]),z,C])]),D])])])}const J=p(b,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-40f5ef0b"]]);export{J as default};
